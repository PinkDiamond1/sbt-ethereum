# Overview

__sbt-ethereum__ strives to be several tools in one:

* An __interactive text-based platform__ with which "hobbyists" &mdash; people who are not programmers, but who are willing to
  devote a bit of time to learning &mdash; can interact with _ethereum_ (and other compatible blockchains), and do so with a great
  deal of power and sophistication.
* For those who are (or wish to become!) programmers, a __rich development environment for _ethereum_ smart contracts__
* An integration tool, which facilitates the development of __high-performance Scala libraries and applications__ that
  interact with _ethereum_ smart contracts
* A __publication tool for _ethereum_ smart contact applications__, as _sbt-ethereum_ repositories strive to be portable, and to
  both permit deployment of new smart contract instances and convenient interaction with already deployed smart contracts.
