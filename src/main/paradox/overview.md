# Overview

### What is sbt-ethereum?

__sbt-ethereum__ strives to be several tools in one:

* An __interactive text-based platform__ with which "hobbyists" &mdash; people who are not programmers, but who are willing to
  devote a bit of time to learning &mdash; can interact with _ethereum_ (and other compatible blockchains), and do so with a great
  deal of power and sophistication.
* A __publication tool for _ethereum_ smart contact applications__, as _sbt-ethereum_ repositories strive to be portable, and to
  both permit deployment of new smart contract instances and convenient interaction with already deployed smart contracts.
* For those who are (or wish to become!) programmers, a __rich development environment for _ethereum_ smart contracts__
* An integration tool, which facilitates the development of __high-performance Scala libraries and applications__ that
  interact with _ethereum_ smart contracts

### Mutual Support

The preferred channel for casual user support is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Please use the tag `sbt-ethereum` on that site.
(The tag does not exist at this writing, but hopefully your questions will bring it forth!)

For training or more in-depth support, please contact [Steve Waldman](mailto:swaldman@mchange.com).

If you would like to support the continued development of _sbt-ethereum_, please do! But wait a few days, until the official
donation address (for Ether and ERC-20 tokens) is made available.

### Development

Source code for _sbt-ethereum_, along with several related projects, is hosted on github.

**Github Repositories**

1. The main project is [swaldman/sbt-ethereum](https://github.com/swaldman/sbt-ethereum)
2. [swaldman/eth-command-line](https://github.com/swaldman/eth-command-line) is a predefined sbt-ethereum
   repository which can be cloned or downloaded to quickly begin interacting with the _Ethereum_ and
   compatible blockchains
3. [swaldman/solidity-seed.g8](https://github.com/swaldman/solidity-seed.g8) is a [giter8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8)
   project template for users interested in developing Solidity smart contracts with sbt-ethereum. An sbt-ethereum project can be
   quickly generated via `sbt new swaldman/solidity-seed.g8`.
4. [swaldman/solidity-scala-seed.g8](https://github.com/swaldman/solidity-scala-seed.g8) is a [giter8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8)
   project template for users interested in integrating Solidity smart contracts with Scala programs, using "stubs" generated by sbt-ethereum.
   An sbt-ethereum project can be quickly generated via `sbt new swaldman/solidity-scala-seed.g8`.
5. [swaldman/consuela](https://github.com/swaldman/consuela) is the library which implements most of the _ethereum_
   functionality that _sbt-ethereum_ relies upon.
