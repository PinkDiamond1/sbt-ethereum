# Warnings

It's all good fun until someone puts out an eye. Or loses all their money.

### Be careful

**Be careful out there!**

### Backup your shoebox and passcodes

@@@ warning

**If you lose the wallet files in your shoebox, or the passcodes that unlock them, you will lose any money or value in them, irrecoverably and forever!**

_sbt-ethereum_ stores wallet files in its internal shoebox directory. You can back up that directory by hand, or use the command `ethShoeboxBackup`.
