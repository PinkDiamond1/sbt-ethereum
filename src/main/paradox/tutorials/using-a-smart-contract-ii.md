# Using a Smart Contract (II)

### Calling methods that change the data on the blockchain

In @ref:[Using a Smart Contract (I)](using-a-smart-contract-i.md#calling-methods-that-change-the-data-on-the-blockchain),
we saw that while we can _access_ data from an _Ethereum_ smart contract for free, if we want to call methods that _change_ the state of the smart contract, we must pay to submit a transaction.

You may recall we tried the command `ethTransactionInvoke fortune addFortune "Make up a better fortune than this, please."`. It failed, because we didn't have enough ETH to pay for the transaction.
Now our default address is funded. So let's try again!
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionInvoke fortune addFortune "Make up a better fortune than this, please."

It seems to have worked!

Let's verify that. Remember `ethTransactionView`, which lets us access the state of a smart contract without modifying it, very easily?
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionView fortune 
countFortunes   drawFortune     fortunes        
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionView fortune countFortunes
[info] The function 'countFortunes' yields 1 result.
[info]  + Result 1 of type 'uint256', named 'count', is 11
[success] Total time: 1 s, completed Jan 4, 2019 10:26:48 PM
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionView fortune fortunes 
<mapping key, of type uint256>   â€‹                                 
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionView fortune fortunes 10
[info] The function 'fortunes' yields 1 result.
[info]  + Result 1 of type 'string' is "Make up a better fortune than this, please."
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 4, 2019 10:27:07 PM
```

We check how many fortunes the smart contract currently knows with `ethTransactionView fortune countFortunes`.
At the time of this writing, there are 11, which would have been indexed from 0 to 10. So we ask for the last, tenth one
-- `ethTransactionView fortune fortunes 10`, and sure enough it is the fortune we have just submitted.

That fortune was really boring though. If you are following along at home, please come up with something better.

Just for the heck of it, let's draw a (quasi)random fortune to learn what will soon befall us.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionView fortune drawFortune
[info] The function 'drawFortune' yields 1 result.
[info]  + Result 1 of type 'string', named 'fortune', is "Your identity is unique!"
[success] Total time: 1 s, completed Jan 4, 2019 10:31:40 PM
```

I feel so very special.
