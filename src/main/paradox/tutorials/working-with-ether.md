# Working with Ether & Multiple Addresses

_Ether_ is the "fuel" of the _Ethereum_ network. Whenever you wish to interact with a smart contract
in a way that might update its state, you have to pay some Ether for the privilege (as we have
@ref:[seen](using-a-smart-contract-i.md), just looking up information from an Ethereum smart contract without
changing anything is always free).

_Ether_ is a "cryptocurrency", like Bitcoin and many others. We'll generally refer to it as ETH.
To work with the Ethereum network, you need a little bit of ETH. _But just a little, not much!_
10 or 20 USD will go a long way, in terms of letting you develop, deploy, and interact with
sanely written Ethereum smart contracts.

@@@ note

While users need a little bit of ETH to interact with the network, __most financial smart contracts &mdash; applications
that manipulate flows of economic value &mdash; should not use ETH as their primary currency or store of value.__

Like most cryptocurrencies, __the value of ETH in terms of real-world goods and services is very, very
volatile.__

It's better to define applications in terms of _stablecoins_, cryptographic _tokens_ whose
value is credibly pegged to a real-world currency like the US dollar.

But be careful, choose well!
Some stablecoins are more credible than others.
Holding value in a bad stablecoin is like holding money in a bad bank with no deposit insurance.
You might lose yur money.

### Checking the Ether balance of addresses

We did this in the @ref:[prior tutorial](using-a-smart-contract-i.md), but let's do it again.
To check your default account's ETH balance, use the command `ethAddressBalance`:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressBalance default-sender
0 ether (as of the latest incorporated block, address 0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2)
This corresponds to approximately 0.00 USD (at a rate of 84.24 USD per ETH, retrieved at 9:13 PM from Coinbase)
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Dec 16, 2018 9:13:59 PM
```

The argument to `ethAddressBalance` is an _Ethereum_ account, which can be provided in all the forms
that _sbt-ethereum_ accepts. We've used the automatic _address alias_ `default-sender`, but we could
also have provided a hex address directly, or an ENS name, like this:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressBalance pejorative.eth
0.36043144606611496 ether (as of the latest incorporated block, address 0x465e79b940bc2157e4259ff6b2d92f454497f1e4)
This corresponds to approximately 30.31 USD (at a rate of 84.1 USD per ETH, retrieved at 9:40 PM from Coinbase)
[success] Total time: 1 s, completed Dec 16, 2018 9:43:51 PM
```
We can also run this command without providing any argument at all! How does that work? **_sbt-ethereum_ relies on the
notion of a _current sender_.** Many commands need to act "on behalf" of a particular _Ethereum_ address, and
use the current sender.

Let's check this out:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderPrint
[info] The current effective sender address is '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2' (with aliases ['default-sender'] on chain with ID 1).
[info]  + This value is the default sender address defined in the sbt-ethereum shoebox for chain with ID 1. 
[info]  + It has not been overridden with a session override or by an 'ethcfgAddressSender' setting in the project build or the '.sbt' folder.
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Dec 16, 2018 10:00:10 PM
```
By default, the current sender is the account we set up during our @ref:[initial setup](getting-started.md) as the default
sender, and which automatically has the alias `default-sender`. However, _we can override the current sender at any time_, using the task
`ethAddressSenderOverrideSet`.

If we try `ethAddressBalance` with no sender, it will use the current sender.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressBalance
0 ether (as of the latest incorporated block, address 0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2)
This corresponds to approximately 0.00 USD (at a rate of 84.22 USD per ETH, retrieved at 10:00 PM from Coinbase)
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Dec 16, 2018 10:04:14 PM
```

@@@ warning

When sending ETH, or tokens, or interacting with _Ethereum_ applications in any capacity, **be sure you understand
on behalf of which _Ethereum_ address you are acting!**

You can run `ethAddressSenderPrint` explicitly, but before transacting on your behalf, _sbt-ethereum_ will always ask
you to confirm your willingness to transact, displaying the "From" _Ethereum_ address for you to verify. Always double check
that you are transact from the address that you intend to transact.

@@@

### Funding an Ethereum address

Before you can really work with _Ethereum_, you will need an address (probably your `default-sender` address) to be funded
with a bit of ETH.

The easiest way to do this is to buy a bit (you don't need much, $10 or $20 is plenty to get started!) from a service such
as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com). On the _Coinbase_ website, once you have bought some ETH, you can go under the "Accounts" tab, find your
Ethereum wallet, and click "Send". Send to your _sbt-ethereum_ default sender address.

If you've forgotten your default sender, try `ethAddressSenderDefaultPrint`.
(Obviously, _send to your own default sender address, **NOT** to the one below!_):
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderDefaultPrint
[info] The default sender address for chain with ID 1 is '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2'.
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Dec 16, 2018 10:28:40 PM

```
Before sending money to your address, you may want to verify that you remember the passphrase that unlocks it.
(If you don't remember the passphrase, the address will receive your funds just fine, but no one will ever, _ever_, be able to access them.
Let's verify, using the command `ethKeystoreWalletV3Validate`:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethKeystoreWalletV3Validate 0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2
[info] V3 wallet(s) found for '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2' (aliases ['default-sender'])
Enter passphrase or hex private key for address '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2': ***************
[info] A wallet for address '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2' is valid and decodable with the credential supplied.
[success] Total time: 8 s, completed Dec 16, 2018 10:33:57 PM
```

The output looks good (note the statement "is valid and decodable with the credential supplied", and the `[success]`). So
we can go ahead and send to this address.

@@@ warning

If you purchasing ETH via websites like Coinbase, **it may take several days before your ETH is available for sending**.

That is annoying, but difficult to avoid.

If you know someone who already has ETH, you can buy it from them informally. Just ask them to send to your address,
and pay them what it's worth in a regular currency.

But it's probably best to keep informal exchanges to small amounts. Large informal exchanges may prompt regulatory
scrutiny.

@@@

One you have some ETH, we can try `ethAddressBalance` again.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressBalance
0.1 ether (as of the latest incorporated block, address 0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2)
This corresponds to approximately 15.30 USD (at a rate of 152.975 USD per ETH, retrieved at 10:52 PM from Coinbase)
[success] Total time: 3 s, completed Jan 2, 2019 10:53:33 PM
```
Hooray! Now we have some Ether to play around with.

### Let's Ping!

To "ping" an address in _sbt-ethereum_ just means to execute a transaction that "sends" 0 ETH. It's mosty useful for
testing purposes, to inexpensively verify that you can actually send from an account. Now that we have a funded account,
let's have it ping itself. Before we start, let's go to <a href="http://etherscan.io"><i>Etherscan</i></a>, and put our own address
in the search field.

@@@ note

<i>Etherscan</i> doesn't know anything about our address alias `default-sender`.

**We have to put in our full hex address**, rather than the aliases we might use to refer to addresses in `sbt-ethereum`.

&nbsp;

@@@

If you have been following these tutorials in order, you'll see just one transaction associated with your address,
the transaction that funded your account.

@@@ div { .centered }

<img alt="etherscan-just-funded" src="../image/etherscan-just-funded.png" width="720" />

@@@

Now let's ping! The command we'll want is `ethTransactionPing`. (Tab completion will get you there with `ethT<tab>P<tab>`.)
You can specify an address to which you mean to direct a transaction, but by default `ethTransactionPing` will cause a sender
address to ping itself.

```

@@@

Notice that our account balance has dropped just a bit from the 0.1 Ether we started with. The (useless) _Ethereum_ transaction we've executed will forever
be a part of the _Ethereum_ blockchain, and modifying the blockchain always costs. We paid 0.000168 Ether (about 2.6&cent; at current prices) for the privilege.

### Creating a Second Address

Besides paying transaction fees, Ether is a cryptocurrency, which we can send between accounts to make payments or for other purposes.
We'd like to try that, but we'll need another address to play with. So let's make one.

The command we'll want is `ethWalletKeystoreV3Create`, which is long, but you'll find that `ethW<tab>K<tab>C<tab>` will get you there.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethKeystoreWalletV3Create

[success] Total time: 14 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 12:21:48 AM

We might try doing as that command suggested, and verifying that we can access the address.
```

[success] Total time: 6 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 12:26:44 AM
```
It's annoying to cut and paste long hex addresses, so let's give our new address an alias.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressAliasSet secondary-address 0x13e3d8d785cdeb1d18f298dcf07ea35a659e157d
[info] Alias 'secondary-address' now points to address '0x13e3d8d785cdeb1d18f298dcf07ea35a659e157d' (for chain with ID 1).
[info] Refreshing caches.

```
@@@ warning

If you forget the passphrase you've just set for this new address, _or_ if you lose the wallet file
_sbt-ethereum_ has just generated, __you will permanently lose access to all value held by your
new account__.

If you intend to let the new address manage significant value, __be sure to store your passphrase
safely__.

Also, __consider backing up the _sbt-ethereum_ "shoebox" now__, which contains (among other things)
the wallet files _sbt-ethereum_ manages. The command would be `ethShoeboxBackup`.

### Checking the Current Sender

Whenever we want to interact with the blockchain, we want to be sure to know from which account we would be interacting. We can always check:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderPrint
[info] The current effective sender address is '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2' (with aliases ['default-sender'] on chain with ID 1).
[info]  + This value is the default sender address defined in the sbt-ethereum shoebox for chain with ID 1. 
[info]  + It has not been overridden with a session override or by an 'ethcfgAddressSender' setting in the project build or the '.sbt' folder.
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 12:40:05 AM
```
Unsurprisingly, the current sender (since we haven't done anything to change it) is the default sender we set up at the very start of these tutorials.
Cool.

### Checking Account Balances

We've seen the `ethAddressBalance` command before. Previously, we just typed the command. By default it checked the current
sender account's balance. But we can also explicitly specify the address we want to check.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressBalance default-sender
0.099832 ether (as of the latest incorporated block, address 0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2)
This corresponds to approximately 15.17 USD (at a rate of 151.945 USD per ETH, retrieved at 12:38 AM from Coinbase)
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 12:42:55 AM
sbt:eth-command-line> 
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressBalance secondary-address

[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 12:43:01 AM
```

@@@ note

Address aliases tab complete just like commands.

Instead of typing out "default-sender" or "secondary-address", you can just type `d<tab>` or `s<tab>`.

&nbsp;

@@@

### Sending Ether

The command to send Ether is `ethTransactionSend`. Let's tab-complete it:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionSend 
<ens-name>.eth        <recipient-address>   default-sender        fortune               secondary-address     
```
Ether will be sent _from_ the current sender. The command asks for a `<recipient-address>`, the address to which you mean to send.

We want to send to our new address. So, tab-completing again...
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionSend secondary-address 
<amount>   
```
After we specify the address to which we mean to send, we have to specify how much we wish to send. Let's send 0.01 Ether (about $1.50 US at this writing).
Let's type 0.01 and tab-complete again.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionSend secondary-address 0.01 
ether    finney   gwei     szabo    wei      
```
To specify an amount, it's not enough to provide a number, you'll need to provide a unit. Usually we specify amounts in terms of Ether, but one Ether is really 10<sup>18</sup> Wei.
One Wei is the minimum amount that the Ethereum blockchain tracks, representing a very tiny amount of value.

We wanted to spend 0.01 Ether, so our command will be:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionSend secondary-address 0.01 ether

Hooray!

### Changing the Sender Address

By default, your _sbt-ethereum_ installation will use the address that is your default sender. You can always find what address that is via `ethAddressSenderDefaultPrint`.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderDefaultPrint

```
For now, the default sender is the same as the current sender. As we've seen, we can find the current sender with:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderPrint
[info] The current effective sender address is '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2' (with aliases ['default-sender'] on chain with ID 1).
[info]  + This value is the default sender address defined in the sbt-ethereum shoebox for chain with ID 1. 
[info]  + It has not been overridden with a session override or by an 'ethcfgAddressSender' setting in the project build or the '.sbt' folder.
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 1:28:35 AM
```
But your default sender can of course be overridden. Let's try `ethAddressSenderOverrideSet`. Using tab completion to help with the address argument:
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderOverrideSet 
<address-hex>       <ens-name>.eth      default-sender      fortune             secondary-address   
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderOverrideSet secondary-address
[info] Sender override set to '0x13e3d8d785cdeb1d18f298dcf07ea35a659e157d' (on chain with ID 1, aliases ['secondary-address'])).
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 1:29:36 AM
```
Now if we check the current sender, we'll see...
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethAddressSenderPrint
[info] The current effective sender address is '0x13e3d8d785cdeb1d18f298dcf07ea35a659e157d' (with aliases ['secondary-address'] on chain with ID 1).
[info]  + This value has been explicitly set as a session override via 'ethAddressSenderOverrideSet'.
[info]  + It has overridden a default sender address for chain with ID 1 set in the sbt-ethereum shoebox: '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2' (with aliases ['default-sender'] on chain with ID 1)
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 3, 2019 1:32:15 AM
```
We can send now, and the Ether will be taken from this new sender address, rather than our default sender. Let's send back some of the Ether we just sent to the secondary address.
```
sbt:eth-command-line> ethTransactionSend default-sender 0.005 ether

It worked!

If you are following along at home, check your account balances, or look up your accounts on <a href="http://etherscan.io/"><i>Etherscan</i></a> to verify that the
transactions and results are as they should be. (But remember that your sending account will always be charged a bit more than you sent! You have to pay transaction fees. In the
lingo, you have to pay "for gas".)

You can interact at any time, from any account you wish. Just use `ethAddressSenderOverrideSet` to define the sender account.
